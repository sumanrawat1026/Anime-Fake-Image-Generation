# README :  Anime Fake Face Generation

GANs are a clever way of training a generative model by framing the problem as a supervised learning problem with two sub-models: the generator model that we train to generate new examples, and the discriminator model that tries to classify examples as either real (from the domain) or fake (generated). The two models are trained together in a zero-sum game, adversarial, until the discriminator model is fooled about half the time, meaning the generator model is generating plausible examples.


Create a GANs generator for some data (images, fonts, etc.)

#### How the GANs works.

The GAN model architecture involves two sub-models: a generator model for generating new examples and a discriminator model for classifying whether generated examples are real, from the domain, or fake, generated by the generator model.

1. Generator. Model that is used to generate new plausible examples from the problem domain. Generative model analyze the distribution in such a way that after the training phase the probability of dicriminator making a mistake maximise.

2. Discriminator. Model that is used to classify examples as real (from the domain) or fake (generated). It is based on model that will estimate the probability the sample is coming from the real data or the generator.

#### Hyperparameters for the GAN Model

For discriminator :

    learn rate is 0.0005
    dropout rate is 0.6
    batch_size is 25

For generator

    learning rate is 0.0001
    momentum is 0.9

### Installation and Running Environment

1. Before running the notebook make sure you have installed below mentioned library in your local system. To install python framework run below mentioned command either in notebook or anaconda command prompt.

        pip install pymongo
        import keras
    
Install the latest verions for better compatibility with python 3.5

2. I have executed the notebook in Google cloud for fast performance. For this below mentioned libraries should be installed.

        !pip install -q kaggle
        !pip install -q keras
        ! mkdir ~/.kaggle
        ! cp kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/
        ! chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
        ! kaggle datasets download --force -d soumikrakshit/anime-faces
        !unzip -q anime-faces.zip -d AnimeFaces
    

3. All related libraries should be present in the local. libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib.

4. Please run all the cells in a given order. Executing cells in random order might result in error.
